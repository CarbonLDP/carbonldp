Carbon LDP™ is a Linked Data application server providing read/write access to RDF graph data over RESTful HTTP. It provides a host of features for developing business applications with Linked Data and for simplifying access to the enterprise knowledge graph. As such, it can act as the key system upon which an organization can build in order to capitalize on the benefits of Linked Data. It consolidates the Linked Data ecosystem within an enterprise into one common access point, or server, and exposes the knowledge graph as easily accessible Web resources through a Web API.
